**Description**
I'm terrible at descriptions.

This application is an interactive Game of Life simulation. 
It uses Conway's original algorithm and produces visuals that can be manipulated via touch. 
As a user touches the screen "gliders" are created.
As cells/objects are created, sounds are played. (Think soundscape like sounds)



**To Be Completed**
1. Shape creation based on a 2d array of live/dead cells
2. More interactivity with the sound
3. ?
